602 Semester Project ReadMe File
The zip file contains the following 5 files:
- 602_semester_project_conorb_readme.txt [this file - explains how to run the code]
- 602_semester_project_conorb.py [the python code]
- EnglishFootballResults.csv [the soccer dataset]
- LondonWeatherStation.csv [the weather dataset]
- 602_semester_project_conorb_notes.pdf [project information and findings]
In order to run the code, the 2 csv files need to be saved to the working directory. The code will pull them in from there. The code produces 2 pieces of output: 1) the detailed regression results are written to the console and 2) the corresponding plots are all written to an output window.
I suggest following the below steps:
1. save the csv files and the python file to the working directory
2. read the notes file
3. run the program
